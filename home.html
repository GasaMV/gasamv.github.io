    <p>GASA sands for Granville Agency Of Space and Aeronautics, the founder of this amazing program is the Deputy Mayor, Andrew L. Thau.  In this program with proper funding we will launch model rockets and make model aircrafts, we will also do extensive but not unnecessary
  research.  During this program you (*Might*) learn lots of things, like the history of rockets to how it is made and works, from how planes works
to how you fly them, and the forces that make the flight possible.</p>
